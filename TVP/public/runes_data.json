It is unknown what led to the development of this spell but it seems to be a curious blend of seemingly contradicting traditions. It is often called the pinnacle of fighting techniques as it uses weapon and body of the combatant in such a devastating  and efficient destruction that it rivals the powerful spells of sorcerers and druids. For a moment the fighter turns into a whirlwind of steel, muscle and determination that can strike down even the most powerful foes."

However, a wary adventurer will not blindly rely on his Sudden Death runes to save him in any position.

Thus, only certain creatures may be summoned, and no summoner has ever managed to control more than two creatures at a time. What is generally agreed upon, however, is that the mental effort that is necessary to summon a creature is determined by the summoned being's strength, so if a strong creature is conjured a lot of mana is required. Also, it has turned out that monsters may only be controlled within a certain radius. If a creature is left behind by its summoner it eventually disappears as the artificial bond that kept it in the world is broken.Needless to say, the spell is widely popular among spell casters, as summoned creatures can be used for a wide variety of tasks."

By calling to the echoes of mother Tibia's own might the god formed new bodies for the spirits and Nornur spun his ghostly webs to bind the old spirits into the new bodies. This summon reflects the strong bond of the Druid towards nature. Besides being a faithful companion, it has a strong natural protection, unifying all powerful and wondrous forces of flora and fauna. Due to its robust wood-fortified arms and bark mask Grovebeast is able to lure hordes of monsters towards itself whilst its master is able to attack from a distance without taking the bulk of the damage. There are tales that all existing animals in the forest originate from an ancestor of this summon. Mother Tibia has endowed this creature with mighty earth spells. Furthermore, physical attacks, carried out by its horns, belong to its repertoire as well. So injured monsters suffer deep wounds, bleeding for quite a while. It is said, that the most devout and skilled heroes are able to gain an intrinsic understanding of such summoning spells, that they are able mould and warp it's energies to call forth a wider array of minions, that, though identical in power and abilities better suit their own taste and style. Initially it was debated if this might be a blasphemous tinkering with a gift of the gods, a rare consensus was reached, that the ability to summon more uncommon allies is rather a deeper understanding of the will and workings of the gods and in concordance with their divine will."

The creature they made the knight's faithful companion is an icecold killer. Only the gods can tell where it originated. Vague legends of old told a story of a vanguard dedicated to Banor who ventured forth into the frozen north in a desperate attempt to stop a scheme of the forces of evil to build a powerful weapon. The heroes of Banor succeeded but at the cost of their lives. Honouring their dedication, Banor struck a deal with an elemental entity of the north who owed their existence to Banor and the heroes' sacrifice. They were entombed deep into the ice, save from all temperings of evil. Their noble souls, however, knew no rest and pleaded Banor to help humanity once again. At last the godly warrior agreed and with the help of Fardos he provided his champions a ghostly squire unlike anything seen before. The energetic essence of ice stemming from the surrounding area was conserved within the newly created ethereal creature. Its deadly sight alone makes not only humans but also monsters tremble in fear. The way of movement - just flying around like a ghost - makes it even more frightening. The Skullfrost doesn't have a very strong defence and prefers to attack from a safe distance. More precisely it uses death and ice attacks. Due to these skills the knight does well to pull its adversaries to himself while its summon attacks from afar. A powerful combination!

Yet the powerful construct needed a soul. So the gods reached out and found a breed of firebirds that were trapped in the Pits of Inferno since aeons for the amusement of the demons. Their pligth and agony might have never ended if the divine forces had not torn down their prison and imbued their souls into their construct, merging it into a creature of overwhelming power, creating the Emberwing in the process. Due to its very long captivity it vowed vengeance to all forces of destruction. These circumstances also explain the passion and dedication with which Emberwing is protecting its master. Its goal is to raze all evil from the lands of Tibia alongside its noble master. The Emberwing is quite an elevated appearance. On first sight one might not think, that this creature is really protective, but indeed it is. The divine fire burning within the creature causes terrible damage to all its offenders.

Its dual nature made a decision almost impossible. Then his eyes fell upon a seemingly unimportant creature deep in the caverns of the mountain Kha'zeel. A group of stone golems had flourished in the magic that was seeping from the fortresses of the mighty Djinn. Their unaging bodies had assimilated more and more magic in the centuries and Uman-Zathroth sensed something else... unrealised possibilities. The godly entity subtly guided the golems to ascend the mighty mountain. Just when the stars were aligned right and another battle of the Djinn had infused a raging storm that ravaged the mountain. Not really recognizing what was driving them, the golems climbed tirelessly until the most sturdy of them managed to reach the peak. During their dangerous ascend, lots of them had ended up smashed on the steep rock face or burried by avalanches. In the end only a few of the mightiest and most self aware of the golems were left. They bathed in the raging forces, struck by lightning, both physical and magical. Again some of them perished but in the end the Thundergiants were born. Steeled by this exhausting journey to the top of Kha'zeel and imbued by mystical energies, the last creatures were chosen by Uman-Zathroth to become the mighty minions of the sorcerer. And it doesn't surprise that they are really strong and powerful, besides being faithful companions of their masters.
